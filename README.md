As a student building this Digital Evidence Chain-of-Custody Tracker, 
I'm using AI tools to help write and refactor this small Flask app. It
logs evidence intake, transfers, verifications, and edits, and provides
export features (CSV/PDF) for reporting.

This project is a hands-on learning exercise in web development,
secure data handling, and deployment. The AI-assisted workflow helped
me iterate quickly while I learned how to integrate forms, storage,
and export utilities.
